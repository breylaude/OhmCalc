# OhmCalc
As I'm building coils, I have to know what current the build is draining from the batteries or how I have to build a coil/wick and atomizer so it fit's my needs.

I created a class "Ohm" the does all the caluculations. And I created a GUI using Tk-widgets like Label, Entry and Button. On button click or return the class "Ohm" is used to calculate the missing values.
